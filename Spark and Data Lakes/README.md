# Project 4 - Data Lake on AWS

## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Description
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. You'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.
  
## Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", 
"artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

## Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.
The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

If you would like to look at the JSON data within log_data files, you will need to create a pandas dataframe to read the data. Remember to first import JSON and pandas libraries.
```
df = pd.read_json(filepath, lines=True)
```
For example, ```df = pd.read_json('data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-01-events.json', lines=True)``` would read the data file ```2018-11-01-events.json```.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and log datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

### Fact Table
1. songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
- songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

**[WARNING] The songplays table does not have a primary key!**  

### Dimension Tables
2. users - users in the app
  - user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level    
3. songs - songs in music database
  - song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration    
4. artists - artists in music database
  - artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude  
5. time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
  - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## ELT Design
In this project, we extract the data from AWS S3, load it to Spark, process it and then save the results to S3.

## Project Template
In addition to the data files, the project repository includes 7 files:
1. ```etl.py``` loads data from S3 into Spark, then processes that data and saves it back to S3.
2. ```dl.cfg``` contains variables to configure properly AWS.
3. ```README.md``` provides the project's description.

## Project prerequisistes
1. Import all the necessary libraries
2. Update the configuration of AWS Cluster ```dl.cfg``` with your personal account details
3. Launch EMR Cluster and Notebook on AWS

## Try the project
To try the project, please follow the following instructions:
1. ``` python etl.py``` *to develop ELT processes for each table*

Once it is over, do not forget to **delete all AWS resources to avoid paying unexpected costs**
